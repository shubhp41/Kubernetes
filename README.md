# Kubernetes Assignment - Cloud-Native CI/CD Pipeline and GKE Deployment

## Assignment Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Kubernetes assignment in the CSCI 5409 Cloud Computing course, Summer 2023. The assignment focuses on building a cloud-native application, implementing a CI/CD pipeline, and deploying the workload to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). It encompasses various key concepts, including containerization, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, and more.

## What I Learned

From this assignment, I gained valuable knowledge and experience in the following areas:

1. **Containerization**: I learned how to containerize applications using Docker, enabling the creation of isolated and reproducible environments for microservices.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: I developed a robust CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, and deployment processes. This streamlined development and ensured seamless integration and deployment to the GKE cluster.

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**: I acquired the skills to provision and manage GKE clusters using Terraform, providing scalability and flexibility in deploying containerized applications.

4. **Persistent Volumes**: I configured and utilized persistent volumes in GKE clusters, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval for microservices.

5. **Kubernetes Tools**: I became proficient in using Kubernetes tools, such as kubectl, for interacting with containers, checking cluster status, and diagnosing issues.

6. **Application Update Strategies**: I learned how to manage application updates within GKE, ensuring version control and smooth deployments.
